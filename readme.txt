Adds "New" and "Beta Testing" tabs to the "Add Plugins" admin page.

== Description ==

After installation, go to Plugins -> Add New

In addition to the default Featured, Popular, Recommended & Favourites, there will be two new tabs called 'New' and "Beta Testing" which enable you to explore and install the plugins most recently added to the WordPress.org plugin directory.

From version 1.2.0 of this plugin, the "New Plugins" tab is the first tab and is selected by default.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Are the plugins shown on the new tab really the newest ones? =

The plugins shown are the ones returned by WordPress.org at [https://wordpress.org/plugins/browse/new/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/browse/new/ "Newest Plugins on WordPress.org")

= Won't using this plugin encourage me to install loads of plugins I don't need on my site? =

It is probably a good idea to use this on a test site to check out new plugins before installing them on your live site.

= Can I also see the most recently updated plugins? =

This plugin does not support that, but you can see this in your browser by going to [https://wordpress.org/plugins/browse/updated/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/browse/updated/ "Most recently updated plugins on WordPress.org")

= I am using the plugin and I love it. How can I show my appreciation? =

You can donate any amount via [my donation page](https://cubecolour.co.uk/wp/ "cubecolour donation page").

If you find this plugin useful, I would also appreciate a review on the [plugin review page](https://wordpress.org/support/view/plugin-reviews/cubecolour-new-plugins/ "New Plugins plugin reviews")

= Are there any other free plugins by the same author? =

Yes these are listed on the [cubecolour plugins page on WordPress.org](https://profiles.wordpress.org/numeeja/#content-plugins "cubecolour plugins on WordPress.org").
